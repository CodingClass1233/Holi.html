	<h1>Holi is almost here and I remember how much fun it is when I was a child, even if I am still a child. People throw colors at each other, but not in their eyes. Holi is celebrated with great enthusiasm in India. In February or March, Holi is celebrated. Holi is a festival of colors and happiness. Holi is mostly celebrated by Hindu peoples all over the world, but now people of all religions celebrate it. In India, people play Holi from the time of Radha and Lord Krishna. Holi is a Hindu festival that celebrates spring, love, and new life. Some families hold religious ceremonies, but for many Holi is more a time for fun. There is dancing, singing, and throwing of powder paint and colored water during this festival.</h1>
